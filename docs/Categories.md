### Global Post Categories
The multisite uses [Global Terms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mu-global-terms/), which makes categories global to the entire network. It uses the main site's table to store all the terms. Sub-sites can currently change the categories, which will affect all sites. To disallow this, change the network permissions.

To organize niche content on sub-sites, use tags.


### Global Event Categories

The multisite uses the Event Manager plugin. 

You could syndicate an RSS/iCal feed from any of categories onto other sites.
